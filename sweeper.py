# this would create the appropriate data set. It's commented out to prevent unnecessary files.
# the dataset initializeation can be called ay any point before during or after the sweep.
# Before it is called, all data (and comments, and parameters) are stored but not written
# When it is called, all stored data (and comments, and parametrs) will be written
# Once is has been called, all data and comments and parameteres are written as they are acquired.
